#J-Query video trick for marketing campaign

Mini project replicating the video switch trick found in Honda UK Interactive Ad 'The Other Side' using jQuery. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3wJsZr27nI

How it works:
 - 2 videos are being run at the same time but only one side is being shown.
 - When the 'R' button is pressed down, the video(VideoA) leaves the screen by changing the CSS properties.
 - The audio(VideoA) is then muted as long as the button is pressed down while unmuting the other video(VideoB).
 - When the 'R' button is released, VideoA enters back the screen while being unmuted.
